    <h3 class="w3-wide">Resistance 2020</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">The discovery and global spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 since December 2019 has resulted in unprecedented "lockdowns" and an erosion of individual freedoms and democratic procedures in most countries around the world. The measures were based on a limited understanding of the virus and uncertain models of its possible spread, which are contested among experts. However, political decision-makers and the mass media do not seem inclined to represent and consider diverging opinions.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">This site aims to provide links to key online resources as a complement to the majority opinions found elsewhere. You will see that many of these resources paint the picture of a pandemic that is much less threatening than originally expected. However, please keep in mind that COVID-19 is a serious illness, just like e.g. influenza. Make sure to follow your local government's regulations, but use this time to inform yourself widely and speak with your family, neighbours, friends, and political representatives.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">The R2020 logo is based on the symbol for an electrical resistor and represents peaceful resistance to the ongoing attack on democracy and civil liberties. The logo also alludes to the letter W for Widerstand (German for resistance, see below) and M for Mayday, a resistance group under the totalitarian regime in The Handmaid's Tale.</p>

    <h3 class="w3-wide w3-center">English-Language Resources</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">Initially, I only knew of German-language resources (see below). In the meantime, several COVID-19 news platforms with different flavours have emerged in the UK: </p>

    <ul class="w3-ul w3-border w3-white w3-text-grey">
      <li class="w3-padding"><a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/" target=_blank>Evidence Not Fear</a> Web site and Twitter account provide many links to key facts, expert opinions, and other Web sites including the following.</li>
      <li class="w3-padding"><a href="http://inproportion2.talkigy.com/" target=_blank>Covid-19 in Proportion</a> Web site and Twitter account, attempts to present COVID-19 statistics in relation to general mortality and other related stats.</li>
      <li class="w3-padding"><a href="https://lockdownsceptics.org/" target=_blank>Lockdown Sceptics</a> takes up the daily news headlines in Britain and adds commentary.</li>
      <li class="w3-padding">The <a href="https://off-guardian.org/" target=_blank>OffGuardian</a> provides rich comment and analysis of a wide range of pandemic-related topics.</li>
      <li class="w3-padding">The <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/tag/coronavirus/">Corbett Report</a> Web site and associated Youtube channel offer sharp analysis and dystopian predictions around COVID-19.</li>
    </ul>

  </div>

  <!-- French -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px" id="french">
    <h3 class="w3-wide w3-center">French-Language Resources</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">I hardly know any French language resources although I am hearing that there is a bit more discussion of alternative approaches in the mass media as compared to the other countries I am familiar with:</p>

    <ul class="w3-ul w3-border w3-white w3-text-grey">
      <li class="w3-padding">The video interview with Switzerland-based Jean-Dominique Michel | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MqArCjrkmI" target=_blank>"Anatomie d'un désastre"</a> | Avril 2020 is listed as a singular resource only because this was the first and only French-speaking information I was aware of for some time.</li>
      <li class="w3-padding"><a href="https://covidinfos.net/ target=_blank">Covidinfos.net</a> - Sources et ressources sur l'épidémie de Covid-19, contains a variety of resources focused on France as well as key international developments. </li>
    </ul>

  </div>

  <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px" id="german">
    <h3 class="w3-wide w3-center">German-Language Resources</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">This is where my journey started - an ever-increasing number of German, Austrian, and Swiss platforms: </p>

    <ul class="w3-ul w3-border w3-white w3-text-grey">
      <li class="w3-padding"><a href="https://swprs.org/" target=_blank>Swiss Propaganda Research</a> has a comprehensive list of facts about COVID-19 based on a huge selection of external sources. It is available in many languages including English and French.</li>
      <li class="w3-padding">Homepage of the earliest voice of reason and one of the most experienced doctors with respect to the public health threat posed by the novel coronavirus, <a href="https://www.wodarg.com/" target=_blank>Dr. med. Wolfgang Wodarg</a>.</li>
      <li class="w3-padding">Youtube channel of one of the earliest and most personable critics of the pandemic panic and lockdowns, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgjxQLDkeoa-uJu4sE0eNrg/" target=_blank>Prof. Dr. med. Sucharit Bhakdi</a>.</li>
      <li class="w3-padding"><a href="https://widerstand2020.de" target=_blank>Widerstand2020 - Deine Mitmach-Partei</a> is a new political party founded on 21 April 2020 and grown to be the 4th-largest German party by membership within 10 days. It's core goal is to restore constitutional freedoms in Germany and enable multi-lateral, participatory democracy. Widerstand2020 was the inspiration to create this site. Their Facebook, Telegram, and Twitter accounts provide more information and debate about the party's ongoing setup.</li>
      <li class="w3-padding"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfPIdT5vkOwQyDAtyhxaFzw/videos" target=_blank>Schwindelambulanz Sinsheim</a> is the Youtube channel of Dr. Bodo Schiffmann, a practicing otolaryngologist (yes, I had to look that up!) turned COVID-19 sceptic turned political activist (and co-founder of Widerstand2020).</li>
      <li class="w3-padding"><a href="https://punkt-preradovic.com/" target=_blank>PUNKT.PRERADOVIC</a> Web site and associated Youtube channel, where independent journalist Milena Preradovic interviews key experts.</li>

      <li class="w3-padding"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/rppinstitut/videos" target=_blank>RPP Institut</a> with videos by Dr. Raphael Bonelli cannily analyzing the ongoing "coronoia" from a psychiatrist's perspective.</li>

    <h3 class="w3-wide w3-center">About this Site</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">Here in Canada, there is virtually no discussion or questioning of the state-of-emergency declared by all provinces and territories and the lockdown rules implemented upon recommendations by the federal, provincial, and municipal medical officers of health. In my social media circles, I earned silence in response to critical posts. In my neighbourhood Facebook groups, I witness an irrational fear of catching the "deadly virus" and consequent calls for the complete shutdown of the country, reporting non-compliant behaviour to the authorities, and prosecuting of transgressions of the social distancing rules. This was and is disturbing for someone who grew up and was educated in a country (West-Germany) and school system that were dedicated to preventing totalitarianism from ever raising its ugly head agin.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Many commenters on corona-sceptical sites report that they are characterized as "conspiracy theorists" and that voicing their opinions with respect to the corona policies alienates friends and family. Parliamentary opposition in Canada and Germany has ceased to exist. The progressive newspapers in both countries are failing to critically monitor government action and I have therefore cancelled my newspaper subscription. I created this site to link platforms that represent a broader range of perspectives. Unfortunately, the vacuum created by conformist newspapers and uncritical public broadcasters also makes room for questionable platforms; reader and viewer discretion in processing the contents of the listed sites is strongly advised!</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">I have written about <a href="https://gis.blog.ryerson.ca/2020/04/08/covid-19-counts-and-curves-a-developing-case-study-in-data-classification-and-normalization-issues/" target=_blank>COVID-19 Counts and Curves</a> as part of my day job but this site represents my personal research and opinions. It is managed via Github and you may be able to contact me there. Claus Rinner, Wasaga Beach, Ontario, Canada - Last update: 3 May 2020.</p>
